ðŸ“‹ Project Overview


A sophisticated 24V 6Ah Battery Management System using STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller and Texas Instruments BQ76952 . Provides comprehensive battery monitoring, protection, and management for 8-series lithium-phosphate cell.
This repository contains the firmware for a 24V 6Ah Battery Management System (BMS) built using the BQ76952 battery monitor IC and STM32F1 microcontroller. The system monitors cell voltages, current, temperature, and protection status, calculates State of Charge (SoC), handles alerts, and displays data on an SSD1306 OLED screen. It supports hardware mode and a simulation mode for development without physical hardware. The project uses FreeRTOS for task management and HAL libraries for peripheral control.
